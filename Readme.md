#  Garlic Mart — Final Web Project

Garlic Mart is a multi-page e-commerce demo website built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript

This project was created by Kha Dao to practice core Frontend development skills including dynamic rendering, localStorage, UI components, and client-side form validation. Ideas are from my mom's business, which is about garlic.
